# myanmar_crowd_map_data
Each of you can help to collect the data of which area of Myanmar are flooded. I will create the visualization layer to provide people better idea and up to date information. I hope this will be helpful and useful for ordinary people as well as people who want to send help and donation to Myanmar. If you have any feedback or ideas, please contact me at <a href="mailto:thein.aungmyint@gmail.com">thein.aungmyint@gmail.com</a>.

# myanmar_crowd_map_data
Each of you can help to collect the data of which area of Myanmar are flooded. I will create the visualization layer to provide people better idea and up to date information. I hope this will be helpful and useful for ordinary people as well as people who want to send help and donation to Myanmar. 
<h2>How to use:</h2>

Home: This page will show which area of Myanmar is having flood. This will be implemented soon. This page also shows how many data points we have collected.<br/>

Send Location Data: This is for you to send the location data of which area of Myanmar you know has flood problem. Find the location using the search bar AND drag the location Pin to fine tune the flooded area location data.

If you have any feedback or ideas, please contact me at <a href="mailto:thein.aungmyint@gmail.com">thein.aungmyint@gmail.com</a>.
